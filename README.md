# DNA-Sequence-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic bioinformatics analysis using Python. It focuses on:

Counting nucleotides (A, T, G, C) in a DNA sequence

Detecting key motifs and codons in a gene sequence (e.g., E. coli LacZ gene)

Applying simple string search algorithms to identify biological patterns

The project highlights how data science and computational methods can be applied to biological data.

## 🧬 Features

Nucleotide Counting – Counts occurrences of A, T, G, and C in any DNA sequence.

Pattern Detection – Finds positions of motifs (e.g., ATG, TAG, TGA, TAA, ATT) in gene sequences.

Example Dataset – Includes analysis of a sample DNA sequence and the E. coli LacZ gene.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Google Colab

Basic Python libraries (no external dependencies required)

## 🎯 Skills Gained

Python programming (string handling, functions)

Data analysis and pattern recognition

Bioinformatics basics (nucleotide counting & codon detection)

Problem-solving and research application
